# *QuickPass* - Simple Password Manager

### A simple password manager able to generate and store log-in info for different users

With the recent rapid growth of the tech industry, new useful services requiring sign-ons are appearing at a rapid pace.
However, this rapid growth also comes with rising concerns about cybersecurity, meaning it is often not as simple as
making an easy-to-remember password or even worse using the same one for all services.<br>

That's where QuickPass comes in, a simple password manager able to generate, edit, remove and store passwords for you
and your loved ones in one place. This service is designed for CS students with too many websites to keep track of like
me, people who want less hassle in their daily lives or just folks who want to have 50 different 50-bit long passwords.
